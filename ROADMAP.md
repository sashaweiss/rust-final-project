## Ideas
- Quick-start function that captures all stdin and replicates all stdout, in one easy line
- Send individual commands/arguments or do it in a stream. Use cases:
  -- Have a bot scripted to do `git` help
  -- Have a gui through which you can send commands
- Send chat commands that get colored, so you can chat and run stuff in the same place
- Have stuff get typed with a delay, so it looks more like typing
- Optionally send key-by-key stdin or on return
